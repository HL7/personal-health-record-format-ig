### Data Model

At the core of the Standard Patient Health Record is the assumption that it will contain records in FHIR format, which provides a data model describing health history that has a pedigree of 30 years of industry experience and use in major EHRs.  

Loosely speaking, this data model contains all data that relevant to a patient's health, whether it be generated by clinicians in a hospital inpatient setting, by a specialist clinic or nursing home, or contributed the patient via gym fitness apps, nutrition tracking apps, and so forth.  The FHIR data model allows this flexibility, while still being informed by clinical learnings on how to code data with SNOMED, LOINC, ICD-10 and other vocabularies, how to organize data into resources, and how to apply region specific extensions and profiles.

As we apply this data model to patient needs, we want to broadly organize it to support personalized medicine, public health laws, and patient empowerment over their own health.  Doing so, we have specific inerests in defining both a physiology model (internal to the patient), a public health & social determinants model (external to the patient), and an administrative executive function model for decision making (things the patient has control over).  In considering models of Self/Other, we posit that a basic psychoanalytic model of Id/Ego/Super Ego satisified this design goals and serves as a useful organizing model.

#### Physiology Resources (Id)

The physiology model is the portion of the SPHR that contains data about structures and processes that are actually occuring within the patient's physical body.  Such things may include vital signs, laboratory biomarkers, an allergic response, a broken arm, an immunization, a radiology report, a genetic sequence, or post-operative notes recorded after a surgery.  The data contained in these data schemas are not the actual metabolic or anatomic processes happening in a human body, but they are cognitive representations of those processes (and therefore loosely analogous with the Id).

A standard patient healthrecord MUST implement the following resources (defined in the Argonaut IG) at a bare minimum.


| FHIR resource | Elements | Standard  | Category  | Argonaut R4    |
| ------------- | :------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------- |

#### Social and Behavioral Resources (SuperEgo)

The patient also exists within a social context, wherein family members, clinicians, and other careteam members all play.  This social context includes social determinants of health, environmental factors, and many external factors that contribute to a patient's health.  

A complete standard patient healthrecord SHOULD implement the following resources that will be used by other systems to describe other actors participating in caregiving activities.  


| FHIR resource | Elements | Standard  | Category  | Argonaut R4  |
| ------------- | :------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------- |
| [CarePlan](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/careplan.html) |  |  |  | Yes |

| [Practitioner](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/practitioner.html) |  |  |  | Yes |
| [RelatedPerson](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/relatedperson.html) |  |  |  | Yes |



#### Administrative Resources (Ego)

Besides modeling the internal physiology (Id) and the social context (Super Ego) of the patient, the Standard Patient Health Record also tracks a number of administrative/legal resources (Ego).  These administrative resources require a certain amount of executive decision making and require the patient (or an authoried delagate) to fill out forms, answer questions, consent to services, manage devies, schedule appointments, and such.  These resources are not about what is happening within the patient's body, or the social context the patient exists in, but rather, reflect the choices that the patient makes and the administrative/legal context of the patient.  

A standard patient healthrecord MUST implement the following for it to accept records from other SPHR systems:


| FHIR resource | Elements | Standard  | Category  | Argonaut R4  |
| ------------- | :------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------- |
| [Appointment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/appointment.html) |  | [Argonaut Scheduling](http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut/scheduling/)   |  | Yes |

### Novel Logical Models

This implementation guide describes a number of novel logical models which address gaps in the FHIR API.  The following models should be considered as potential candidates for moving into the core FHIR spec in R5 or R6.  

- [HealthReceipt]()
- [SocialMedia]()
- [Environmental]()
- [NutrientOuttake]()
