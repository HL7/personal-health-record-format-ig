## Description
This table provides a comprehensive mapping of Personal Health Record (PHR) data items across multiple coding systems and platforms.
It includes mappings between HealthKit (iOS), Health Connect (Android), LOINC codes, and SNOMED CT codes for items included in the International Patient Summary (IPS).
This facilitates interoperability and data integration across different health data ecosystems.
