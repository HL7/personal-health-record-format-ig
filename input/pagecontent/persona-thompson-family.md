### Narrative History


Patient Journey Summary for Case Study #8675309T - The Thompson Family

__Patient Information__

Patient: Three-year-old child  
Diagnosis: Leukemia  

On the bone marrow transplant list
Parents are considering having another child in hopes of finding a suitable bone marrow match

__Recommendation__  

Start chemotherapy to treat the leukemia.
Chemotherapy:

Administered orally, intravenously (usually through a port), or intrathecally.
Can temporarily affect the bone marrow's ability to produce adequate blood cells.
Associated with various side effects.
Benefits of a Bone Marrow Transplant:

If successful, it can replace diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow.
Offers the potential for a longer and healthier life.
Likelihood of Finding a Bone Marrow Match:

The chance of a child being HLA identical is 25%.

Approximately 91% to 99% of patients on the bone marrow transplant list have a suitable match.
Only 30% of patients have a relative who is a donor.


__Risks of a Bone Marrow Transplant__

The risks vary depending on age, the type of disease, and overall health.


__Post-Transplant Care__

Patients may experience complications, which can range from mild to severe.

High risk of infection, requiring the use of medications and transfusions.

Close monitoring for signs of engraftment.

Patients may go home after 30 to 100 days, with a stronger immune system.

In this case, it's recommended to start with chemotherapy for the child's leukemia. While the parents are considering having another child in hopes of finding a bone marrow match, the patient's chances of finding a suitable donor from within the family are relatively low. The benefits of a successful bone marrow transplant include the potential for a longer and healthier life. However, the procedure carries risks, and post-transplant care is essential for monitoring and managing potential complications.
