The core idea has been to establish a robust mechanism for bidirectional synchronization of electronic health records (EHRs) between clinical systems, ancillary services, personal health record (PHR) platforms, and the patient's own health apps and devices. By leveraging standards like FHIR and NDJSON, this PHR approach enables  exchange of structured medical data.

#### Record Lifecycle Operations

However, once we have structured data, we need to consider the details of how we construct longitudinal records from multiple sources. In doing so, we are inspired by both the PHR-S Functional Model Record Lifecycle specifications and the Git utility (which is a distributed version control system that allows multiple users to collaborate on a project while maintaining a complete history of changes).  In Git, each record is added to a "repository" and can be "committed" with a timestamp and a message (RI.1.1.2).  The repository can be "cloned" to create a local copy (RI.1.1.9), and changes can be "pulled" from the repository and "pushed" or merged into it (RI.1.1.19).  We would draw the reader's attention to how these operations are similar to the PHR-S Functional Model Record Lifecycle operations.  By aligning these two approaches, we can leverage the power of both acylic graphs and the PHR-S Functional Model Record Lifecycle specifications to create a robust mechanism for managing longitudinal records.

Importantly, this architecture suggests a formal record-keeping mechanism by which we can manage,  index, update,merge, and export entire medical histories from a system. This formal mechanism is known as a Directed Acylic Graphs (DAGs), which are designed to ensure data integrity and consistency. Each record is assigned a unique [SHA-256](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/sha-256-algorithm) hash, and the hash of each record includes the hash of the previous record in the chain. This creates a tamper-evident, immutable record of the patient's health data.

#### Consolidation of Distributed Records 

This is a key aspect of the PHR approach, as it allows for both patient-initiated data sharing and provider-initiated data retrieval.

Key aspects of the above diagram include:  

- The EHR system acts as the central "master" repository, serving as the authoritative source of truth for the patient's health data. Updates and changes originate from the EHR.  
- Ancillary services like labs and radiology systems have synchronized their records with the EHR, sending new data and receiving updates.  
- The PHR system, which the patient has access to, also synchronizes with the EHR, allowing the patient to view, contribute to, and manage their health information.  
- The patient's own health apps and personal devices can connect to the PHR system, pulling data and sending new health metrics or self-reported information to be incorporated into the patient's comprehensive record.  
- The diagram depicts a branching model, with the EHR acting as the "main" branch, and various "feature" branches representing the different connected systems and devices. Merging changes between these branches, similar to a Git workflow, ensures data integrity and consistency.  

This approach offers several benefits: it empowers patients to be active participants in their healthcare, enables real-time data sharing between providers and ancillary services, and creates a comprehensive, longitudinal view of the patient's health history. The use of standardized data formats and versioning principles helps address challenges around data silos, fragmentation, and lack of interoperability that often plague traditional healthcare IT systems.

#### Architecture Features

Directed acyclic graph interpretation of Personal Health Records allow a number of architectural features that implementors are encouraged to consider:

##### Authoritative Repository Management:

Both EHR and PHR systems act as legally recognized  repositories of medical data for patients.  It is the duty of clinicians and hospital administrators to keep these records up to date and accurate, to the fullest extent possible.  These repositories are accessible to patients via the 21st Century Cures Act.

##### Branching and Merging:

Each connected system (e.g., labs, radiology, PHR, patient apps) manages it's own records about the patient, and is treated as a "feature" branch, diverging from the main EHR or PHR branch.

When a system needs to sync data, it performs a FHIR based GET operation from the other system to fetch a specific patient's records.  The system then makes its own updates in its internal record keeping system. In the case of a PHR, typically implemented as a single-user system, the patient will be the user of the application.  

When ready to push changes back to the EHR or other system, the system performs a POST operation, which initiates a record update and merge back into the main EHR branch.  The EHR system utilizes it's internal merge strategies and conflict resolution algorithms to ensure data integrity during the merging process.


##### Versioning and Change Tracking:

Each commit to the EHR's main branch represents a new version of the patient's medical data, with associated metadata (author, timestamp, change description, etc.).  In the case of a PHR, the author will be the patient owner.

Connected systems can use `log` and `diff` style commands to review the history of changes and understand the evolution of the patient's health records over time.


##### Replication and Synchronization:

When a new system (e.g., a patient's PHR) connects to the framework, it performs a `clone` of the EHR's main repository to obtain a local copy of the patient's full medical history.

Subsequent updates are handled through the standard `pull` and `push` operations, ensuring that all connected systems maintain a consistent view of the patient's data.


##### Rollback and Recovery:

When issues arise, the framework utilizes `revert` and `reset` commands to rollback changes or restore the patient's medical data to a previous known-good state.  This versioning and commit history provide a reliable audit trail and enables recovery from data corruption or accidental modifications.


##### Offline Capabilities and Conflict Resolution:

This architecture allows connected systems like PHRs to maintain local "feature" branches and perform occasional pull and sync operations with the central EHR repository.
